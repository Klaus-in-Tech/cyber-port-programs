Key differences to highlight are:

*   **Ownership Requirement**: The CIP has a specific requirement that the applicant owns more than 51% of the company shares, or provides an authorisation letter. The CCMF does not have this requirement.
*   **Focus**: The CCMF emphasizes project viability, innovation, and social responsibility. The CIP places greater emphasis on company background, business performance, implementation, and revenue generation.
*   **Milestones**: The CCMF requires a 6-month project milestone, while the CIP requires business performance and milestones every six months throughout the entire incubation period.
*   **Resubmission**: The CIP requires specific information on previous applications to Cyberport or other government funding schemes if it is a resubmission.
*   **Company Details**: The CIP requires more information about the company background, including history, ownership, and any pilot work, which is not specifically required for CCMF.
*   **Level of detail**: In general, CIP asks for a higher level of detail, especially when it comes to revenue, team and the company's operational aspects.

Please note that both programmes require similar basic documentation, such as company documents, identity documents, and presentation slides, as well as an abstract in both Chinese and English.
